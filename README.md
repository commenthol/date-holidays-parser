[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/date-holidays-parser.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-holidays-parser/)
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/commenthol/date-holidays-parser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/commenthol/date-holidays-parser)

This module provides a parser for [date-holidays][] which does calculation of
holidays dates for various countries, states and regions by type while
considering the applicable timezone.

The features are:

- calculation of public, bank and observance holidays for different
  countries, state, region, following ISO 3166-2
- consideration of timezones for holiday checks
- consideration of start and end time dependent on timezone
- substitute days
- multi-language support for all holiday names
- setting of custom holidays
- uses own grammar for calculation of days
- support for islamic calendar from 1970 to 2080 (*islamic dates might
  not be correct as they are subject to the sighting of the moon)
- support for hebrew calendar from 1970 to 2100
- support for chinese calendar

Happy holidays!

## Usage

```js
const data = require('date-holidays/data/holidays.json')
const Holidays = require('date-holidays-parser')
const hd = new Holidays(data)

// get supported countries
hd.getCountries()
/*>
{ AD: 'Andorra',
  ...
  US: 'United States' }
*/

// get supported states e.g. for US
hd.getStates('US')
/*>
{ al: 'Alabama',
  ...
  wy: 'Wyoming' }
*/

// get supported regions e.g. for US, Lousiana
hd.getRegions('US', 'la')
/*>
{ no: 'New Orleans' }
*/

// initialize holidays for US, Lousiana, New Orleans
hd.init('US', 'la', 'no')
// or using a new instance
hd = new Holidays('US', 'la', 'no')

// get all holidays for the year 2016
hd.getHolidays(2016)
/*>
[ { date: '2016-01-01 00:00:00',
    start: Fri Jan 01 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST),
    end: Sat Jan 02 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST),
    name: 'New Year\'s Day',
    type: 'public' },
  ...
  { date: '2016-11-24 00:00:00',
    start: Thu Nov 24 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST),
    end: Fri Nov 25 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST),

    end: Tue Dec 27 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST),
    substitute: true,
    name: 'Christmas Day (substitute day)',
    type: 'public' } ]
*/

// check if date is a holiday while respecting timezones
hd.isHoliday(new Date('2016-02-09 00:00:00 GMT+0000'))
//> false
hd.isHoliday(new Date('2016-02-09 10:00:00 GMT-0600'))
/*>
{ date: '2016-02-09 00:00:00',
  start: Tue Feb 09 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST),
  end: Wed Feb 10 2016 00:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST),
  name: 'Mardi Gras',
  type: 'public' }
*/
```

## Holiday object

`getHolidays()` as well as a matching `isHoliday()` call return either
a list or a single holiday object which consists of:

* {String} date - ISO Date String of (start)-date in local format
* {Date} start - start date of holiday
* {Date} end - end date of holiday
* {String} name - name of holiday using `language` (if available)
* {String} type - type of holiday `public|bank|school|optional|observance`
* {Boolean} substitute - (optional) if true holiday substitutes another holiday`
* {String} note - (optional) note`

### Dates

The `date` String represents the start date of the holiday in ISO
format without timezone. This string it intended for information only.

`start` and `end` are the start/end date of the holiday within the
selected timezone of the country, state, region.

### Name

The `name` names the holiday in the local language of the selected
country, state, region. The applied language(s) can be requested using
`getLanguages()`.

The language can be changed using the `setLanguages()` method. In case
that not translation is available a fall-back to the next given
language will be made. E.g. local language is "fr",
`setLanguages('nl')` was called. For all holidays where no dutch
translation is available the French version will be used instead.

All holiday names should support an English translation.

### Types of holidays

Currently the following type with their meaning are supported

type        | meaning                                   
----------- | ------------------------------------------
public      | public holiday                            
bank        | bank holiday, banks and offices are closed
school      | school holiday, schools are closed        
optional    | majority of people take a day off         
observance  | optional festivity, no paid day off       

Additionally a `note` field is sometimes available for further
clarification.
